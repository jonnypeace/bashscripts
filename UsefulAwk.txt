Some awk examples

You'll see further examples of awk used in my scripts, using arrays, and combined with sed.

Changed the first column to bingo
ls -l | awk '{$1="bingo"; print $0}'

If first column = "test1" in the testfile.csv with field seperator comma (,)
it'll print second column.
awk -F, '{if ($1 == "test1") print $2}' testfile.csv

Searches for string "test1" in the testfile.csv with field seperator comma (,)
and prints second column.
awk -F, '/test1/ {print $2}' testfile.csv

prints the first row from the ls -l output
ls -l | awk 'NR==1 {print}'
