Some awk examples

You'll see further examples of awk used in my scripts, using arrays, and combined with sed.

Changed the first column to bingo
ls -l | awk '{$1="bingo"; print $0}'

If first column = "test1" in the testfile.csv with field seperator comma (,)
it'll print second column.
awk -F, '{if ($1 == "test1") print $2}' testfile.csv

Searches for string "test1" in the testfile.csv with field seperator comma (,)
and prints second column.
awk -F, '/test1/ {print $2}' testfile.csv

prints the first row from the ls -l output
ls -l | awk 'NR==1 {print}'

Input and Output field separators
awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="/"}{NF--; print}' <<< /1/2/3/4/5/6
This will set the field separator and output FS to /, and the {NF--; print} excludes the last field.

awk -F/ '{NF--; print}' <<< /1/2/3/4/5/6
Excluding the FS=OFS leaves a different output with spaces.
