  apt install nodejs npm unzip git curl

2. then once npm is installed...

  So instead visit https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/releases
  and (most recent release at this time)
  wget https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/releases/download/v0.20.7/tree-sitter-linux-x64.gz

  I have a local .bin for my user, in my $HOME, so...
  gunzip tree-sitter-linux-x64.gz > $HOME/.bin/tree-sitter

  make sure $HOME/.bin is in your path. export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.bin"
  add this to your .bashrc
