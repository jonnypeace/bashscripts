All files here are for the host server set up. 

Some configs, 1 service and a couple of my scripts to keep my NFS shares ticking over with rsync backups.

I used a service to mount the drives because i'm not a fan of a headless system hanging on boot, with the auto option in fstab.
Also crontab works fine, but I found mail clutter (i know that can be turned off) and it only needs run at boot.

DO NOT copy over your own configs with these configs, these are just examples.

Each file will need some modifications to suit your set up.. usernames, directories, drive names, /dev/sda etc.

Each file has some help inside them, if more info required, feel free to message me (jonny) at royalpython2@hotmail.com

Hopefully helpful for those like me.
