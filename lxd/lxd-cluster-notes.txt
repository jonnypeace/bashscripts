# to see all nodes

# set up remote connection on ubuntu1
lxc config set core.trust_password jphome
lxc list # check ip for ubuntu1

# on ubuntu laptop, add remote connection
lxc remote add ubuntu1 10.10.100.41
lxc remote switch ubuntu1 - any subsequent reboots will require this

# add some containers
lxc launch images:ubuntu/22.04 jellyfin
lxc launch images:ubuntu/22.04 fast-ubuntu
lxc list # to see the distributed containers

# see size of storage pool for lxd
lxc storage info lxd_storage_pool

#connect to container
lxc exec fast-ubuntu bash

# to launc a lxd vm on a specific node
lxc launch images:ubuntu/22.04/cloud ubuntu-vm1 --vm --target ubuntu3

# after creating one virtual machine, that node will be faster at creating another because of zfs and duplication

# instruct to shutdown instances
lxc cluster evacuate ubuntu3

# bring back up instances
lxc cluster restore ubuntu3

# when shuting down instances like above, you can tell lxd to move the instances to another node by default, rather than just stopping them
lxc profile set default cluster.evacuate migrate

# if currently running vms complain about being updated because they are running, it's ok, the profile will still be updated.. see below.

lxc profile show default

# now when you evacuate and restore, migration will happen automatically.
